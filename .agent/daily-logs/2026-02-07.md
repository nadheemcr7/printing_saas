# Daily Activity Log - 2026-02-07

## 🚀 Summary
Today was a massive leap for **Solve Print**. We moved from a basic project setup to a fully functional "Smart Engine" with AI-powered file analysis and a secure, 0%-fee payment verification system.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- **Project Structure**: Created modular SQL migrations and organized documentation in `main-docs/`.
- **Authentication**: Implemented multi-role auth (Owner/Customer) with custom metadata in Supabase.
- **AI File Inspector**: Integrated **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to automatically count PDF pages and detect color profiles.
- **Smart Payment Engine**:
    - Built a mobile-first UPI intent system ("One-Tap" pay button).
    - Designed and implemented **AI Screenshot Verification** to confirm payments without gateway fees.
- **Dashboards**: Created real-time synced dashboards for both Students (Mobile) and Owners (Desktop).
- **Storage**: Configured high-security Supabase Storage buckets with RLS.

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **AI Screenshot vs. Razorpay**: Chose AI verification to keep 100% of profit for the local shop owner while maintaining a "magical" experience for the student.
- **UPI Intent**: Switched from pure QR codes to deep-links to accommodate students using the app on their own mobile devices.

## 📂 Major File Changes
- `src/components/UploadModal.tsx`: Core file for file analysis and payment flow.
- `src/components/PaymentView.tsx`: New component for UPI handling and AI verification.
- `src/lib/gemini.ts`: Updated to handle multi-modal inputs (PDFs and Images).
- `supabase/migrations/`: Created 7 modular SQL files for a robust DB foundation.

## ⏭️ Next Steps
- Implement **Owner Settings** page (Update VPA & Page Rates).
- Add **Emergency UPI Switch** for the owner.
- Build the **"Handover" logic** (Owner marks ready -> QR/Code check).
- 24-hour document auto-cleanup.
