# Daily Activity Log - 2026-02-07

## 🚀 Summary
Today was a massive leap for **Solve Print**. We moved from a basic project setup to a fully functional "Smart Engine" with AI-powered file analysis and a secure, 0%-fee payment verification system.

## ✅ Tasks Completed
- **Project Structure**: Created modular SQL migrations and organized documentation in `main-docs/`.
- **Authentication**: Implemented multi-role auth (Owner/Customer) with custom metadata in Supabase.
- **AI File Inspector**: Integrated **Gemini 1.5 Flash** to automatically count PDF pages and detect color profiles.
- **AI Screenshot Verification**: Designed and implemented verification to confirm payments without gateway fees.
- **Ridha Printers Branding**: Configured the store identity across all dashboards.
- **Advanced Pricing Engine**:
    - Implemented tiered B/W pricing (₹2/₹1.5).
    - Custom logic for Single/Double side and Color prints.
- **Owner Control Panel**:
    - Build a settings page for VPA switching and shop open/close toggles.
    - Real-time shop status sync for customers.
- **Order Handover System**: Implemented a 3-digit verification code system for secure counter-side delivery.
- **Business Analytics**: Created a dedicated revenue tracking dashboard for shop owners.

## 💡 Technical Decisions
- **AI Screenshot vs. Razorpay**: Chose AI verification to keep 100% of profit for the local shop owner.
- **Handover RPC**: Used a secure Postgres function to atomicly verify codes and update order status.
- **Real-time Subscriptions**: Leveraged Supabase Realtime for instant status updates on student phones.

## 📂 Major File Changes
- `src/app/dashboard/owner/analytics/page.tsx`: New business intelligence dashboard.
- `src/components/HandoverModal.tsx`: New verification UI for the counter.
- `supabase/migrations/10_analytics_rpc.sql`: Database-level analytics logic.
- `PROGRESS.md`: All core milestones marked as **COMPLETE**.

## ⏭️ Next Steps (Self-Maintenance)
- Monitor AI verification accuracy.
- Periodic backup of database schema.
- System is now **Production Ready** for Ridha Printers.
